# hotel
the hotel management system was designed to create, book, remove, and charge rooms for guests in an imaginary hotel. Where we had specific instructions on creating these imaginary rooms taking inputs such as if the guests want AC, the size of bed in the room, comfortability of the beds, as well as the daily rate the we as the hotel would charge the guest. After magically creating this room, the manager could book this room for whichever guest was interested, taking the guest information such as name, address, and phone number. We always save the names of our guests in our books in case they would like to return, as well as the room that they had previously stayed in, in case they would like to stay in the same room again. If room is somehow destroyed or undergoing renovations, we can simply remove said room from the options, and guests are no longer able to rent the rooms.
